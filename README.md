# SpaceShipBrrr
This is a pretty simple game where the player maneuvers the ship to avoid the rocks.
<br/>
Aim them rocks and shoot to score!
<br/>
Take a hit once and you lose!

This project is made in order for me to learn how to make a game using GameMaker.
<br/>
I used their project template and followed their tutorial.
